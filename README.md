# pytoshearlab

pytoShearLab is a toolbox containing a 2D shearlet transform in pytorch, based on [pyShearLab](http://na.math.uni-goettingen.de/pyshearlab/) by Stefan Look and ShearLab 3D by Rafael Reisenhofer.

# Implementation Details

The toolbox currently consists of a 2D shearlet transform for quadratic images, where shearlet transform together with inverse and adjoint operations are available.
